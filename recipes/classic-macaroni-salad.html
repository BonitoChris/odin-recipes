    <h2>Can You Make Macaroni Salad Ahead of Time? </h2>

    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
    <p> “This recipe is fantastic, I tasted it when I finished mixing,” says Sue Newman. “WOW, can't wait for it to get
        cold. I did make a couple of changesL I used celery salt instead of just salt and left the green pepper and
        pimento out.”</p>
    <p> “Great flavor,” raves one Allrecipes community member. “I used cellentani pasta and only ⅓ cup sugar. Also used
        some garlic powder and did not use bell pepper or pimento. Perfect accompaniment to our BBQ.”</p>
    <p>
        “This is a fantastic pasta salad,” according to Rebecca Timbers. “The only drawback is I have found is that now
        I am required to bring a big bowl to every family gathering no matter the season or holiday!”</p>
